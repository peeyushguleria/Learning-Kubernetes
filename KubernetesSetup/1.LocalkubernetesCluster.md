### What is Minikube?
Minikube is an all-in-one system, i.e., no multiple architectures of Master and Worker nodes are required. The same system acts as the Master as well as the Worker node. It can be used for testing purposes.

Minikube creates a single node cluster inside a VM on your laptop. Even though it's not ideal for production since we won't be able to demonstrate some of the features Kubernetes provides in a multi-node setup, it should be more than enough to explain most of the concepts behind Kubernetes.
Before we dive into Minikube, there are a few prerequisites that we should probably set up. The first one of them is Kubectl. Kubectl is a Kubernetes command-line tool used to manage a cluster and applications running inside it.
