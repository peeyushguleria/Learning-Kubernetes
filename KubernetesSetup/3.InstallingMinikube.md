### How to Install Kubernetes Minikube
The next step is installing the minikube. Now minikube, like we mentioned previously, is a local Kubernetes cluster, focusing on making it easy for you to learn and develop Kubernetes for testing purposes. Some of the prerequisites that you can see over here are regarding your system resources, for example, 2 CPUs or more, 2GB of free memory, 20GBs of free disk space, an internet connection for obvious reasons, and a container or a virtual machine manager. I will be using Docker. You can also use something like a VirtualBox or similar

### Installing Minikube on your local Kubernetes Cluster
Now to install, go to https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start, and you can install minikube related to your particular operating system and the architecture. et's try to validate this now. With the command minikube version you can see it's particularly running, and now we're ready to give our cluster a spin.

### Spinning up a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube
Let's look into a few more things related to minikube and how we can start minikube on our Kubernetes and spin up a Kubernetes cluster using this. So the folks behind minikube made this thing very easy to use. All you need to do is execute one single command. So Minikube will start a virtual machine locally and deploy all the necessary Kubernetes components into it. This VM will get configured with Docker and Kubernetes via a single binary known as the local Kube. So you can use the command minikube start and I have Docker running over here, so it's going to be using that. But if you're using VirtualBox, use something like a VM driver equal to VirtualBox. So let's start it as it is.
Now let's try to verify this. I see that it is running. Hence, you can use the command kubectl get pods to verify it. Furthermore, you can use the command to view the pods created previously.

But suppose you want to see the verification and look at the status of the cluster. In that case, you can use the command minikube status and you will see Kube configured, API server kubelet, host, and type control plane, and everything listed over. So now our Kubernetes minikube is running, and it is initializing a Kubernetes cluster as well. It even configured kubectl to point to the newly created virtual machine.

### Minikube dashboard
Let's also explore the Kubernetes dashboard. So if you type this command called minikube dashboard, we will be automatically redirected to a particular URL that you can see on the screen.
