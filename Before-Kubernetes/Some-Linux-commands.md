Hello, everyone, before diving into the concepts of Docker and Kubernetes, it is very important that we know some basic Linux commands that we will be using throughout our journey.<br>

### Commands and their meaning.<br>

1. ls = list command, i.e gives list of information about the files and directories in the current directory.
2. ls -ltr = gives a little more information about that.
3. mkdir = create a directory.
4. cd = changing the directory.
5. cd .. = go to the previous directory.
6. touch = create a file in a directory.
7. vi = to add content inside the above created file , press 'I' to get in the insert mode and when content addition is done , press 'esc' and type ':x' or ':wq!' and enter.
8. cat = to view what's inside the file.
9. clear = to clear the screen whatever is present on it.
10. cp = copy the file and also add the directory to where you want to copy it(ex: cp names.txt hello , where hello is a directory) hence a copy will be present at the original location as well.
11. mv = same as cp command but here file will be completely moved , i.e no copy is remained in the original directory.
